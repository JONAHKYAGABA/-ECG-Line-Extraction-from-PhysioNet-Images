# ECG Line Extraction from PhysioNet Images

This project demonstrates a computer vision pipeline to extract the **electrocardiogram (ECG) waveform** from ECG image data provided by the **PTB-XL dataset** on [PhysioNet](https://physionet.org/). The approach focuses on isolating the ECG trace from the background and preparing it for further signal processing or machine learning tasks.
